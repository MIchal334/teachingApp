#TeachingApp

#Overview

This application is designed to assist users in learning English. It provides a platform where users can complete lessons, while administrators can manage both lessons and users. 
The backend is built using Java with the Spring Boot framework, and it features a three-layered architecture. The application uses JWT for authentication and authorization, and the data is managed with a MySQL database, with migrations handled by Flyway. Docker Compose is used to simplify the deployment process.
